//TODO List
//Should all of these tests have dynamic phase between packets? How to implement that...
//Determine how to do continuous tx/rx instead of packet-by-packet
//How might I simulate clock drift over time...
//Ensure all phases can sync properly in func_test.c
//Probably do all tests @ 2 samp/bit? Any advantage to 4?
